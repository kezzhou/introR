# Introduction to R
HHA 507 // Week 8 // Assignment 8

## There are three R lessons covered in this repository:

+ _HBCTraining's Introduction to R_ (Open Source on Github)
Part 1
1. Introduction to R and RStudio
2. R Syntax and Data Structure
3. Functions and Arguments
4. Reading in and inspecting data
Part 2
1. Data Wrangling: Subsetting Vectors and Factors
2. Packages and libraries
3. Data wrangling: data frames, matrices and lists

+ Bookdown Demo The R Environment
1. Chapter 1: The R Environment
2. Chapter 2: Getting Started with Data
3. Wrangling and Visualizing Data

+ _Eric Feigelson's Introduction to R_ (Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers XVII, June 2022)
1. Section I
2. Section II
3. Section III

## Description:

In this repo we shift focus from our primary language thus far, Python, to R. R is powerful for statistical analysis and tools like RStudio allow for easy visualization of data. Much of the logic structure used in Python is somewhat applicable to R. For example, defining functions and creating databases in R is reminiscient of Python's Pandas functionalities. R offers flexibility in its use of vectors and vector-stacking when creating databases.

## Requirements:

- R/Rstudio/Equivalent
- Jupyter/Google Colab/Equivalent

## Notes:

It appears that the cardiac dataset referred to in Bookdown's Demo R Lesson is missing. As a result, we use the paygap dataset referenced in Chapter 2 of the lesson where applicable/appropriate.

It's important to note that by default, Google Colab may not save outputs when saved locally as a notebook. This can be modified by navigating to Edit > Notebook Settings > Uncheck "Omit code cell output when saving this notebook" within Google Colab.
