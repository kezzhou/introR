# Introduction to R
HHA 507 // Week 8 // Assignment 8

## There are two R lessons covered in this repository:

+ _HBCTraining's Introduction to R_ (Open Source on Github)
Part 1
1. Introduction to R and RStudio
2. R Syntax and Data Structure
3. Functions and Arguments
4. Reading in and inspecting data

+ _Eric Feigelson's Introduction to R_ (Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers XVII, June 2022)
1. Section I
2. Section II
3. Section III

## Description:

In this repo we shift focus from our primary language thus far, Python, to R. R is powerful for statistical analysis and tools like RStudio allow for easy visualization of data. Much of the logic structure used in Python is somewhat applicable to R. For example, defining functions and creating databases in R is reminiscient of Python's Pandas functionalities. R offers flexibility in its use of vectors and vector-stacking when creating databases. Although there are multiple sections to each lesson listed above, we are only covering introductory material.

## Requirements:

- R/Rstudio/Equivalent
- Jupyter/Google Colab/Equivalent

## Notes:

It's important to note that by default, Google Colab may not save outputs when saved locally as a notebook. This can be modified by navigating to Edit > Notebook Settings > Uncheck "Omit code cell output when saving this notebook" within Google Colab.
