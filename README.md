# introR
HHA 507 // Week 8 // Assignment 8

## In this repo we shift focus from our primary language thus far to a new one: R. R is powerful for statistical analysis and tools like RStudio allow for easy visualization of data. Much of the logic structure used in Python is somewhat applicable to R.

## There are two main components to this repository. The first is the .RProj and .R file, along with complementary csv and txt files. These files include lessons 1.1 to 1.4 found at: https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/schedules/links-to-lessons.html.

## The second is a jupyter notebook file that focuses not only on data storage and data structure creation like the .R and .RProj files but also visualization and graphical tools provided by R's capabilities.
